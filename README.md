# Javascript_Password_Generator

I have been assigned a starter index.html / script.js / style.css sheet and asked to create a random password generator.
The generator has a series of prompts it must ask the client before automatically generating a password.
Prompts I will include:
    Length: 8-128 charecters
    Lowercase y/n
    Uppercase y/n
    Numbers y/n
    Specia charecters y/n
